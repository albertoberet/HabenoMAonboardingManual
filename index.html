      <div class="section" id="fundamentals">
        <h2 style="text-align:center;">I. NON-NEGOTIABLE FUNDAMENTALS (The Core Rules)</h2>

         <h3>Q1. LTV & Capital Cushion – The 40–45% Rule</h3>
        <p><strong>Principle:</strong> Spanish banks finance 60–70% of the lower of purchase price or appraisal. Clients must provide the remaining 30–40% plus ~10–15% for taxes and fees.</p>
        <p>Spanish banks typically finance <strong>between 60% and 70%</strong> of the <strong>lower value</strong> between the purchase price and the official appraisal (tasación). This means that if the property is valued lower than the agreed purchase price, the loan amount will be calculated based on the appraisal figure.</p>
        
        <p>As a result, clients must contribute the remaining <strong>30–40%</strong> of the property value from their own funds. In addition to this contribution, they should also budget approximately <strong>10–15%</strong> extra to cover <strong>associated taxes, notary and registry fees, legal costs, and bank expenses</strong>.</p>
        
        <p>This structure ensures that buyers demonstrate financial stability and commitment to the purchase while protecting banks from overexposure to market fluctuations. Junior advisors should always explain this clearly to clients early in the process to avoid misunderstandings about the total funds required for completion.</p>
        <div class="advice">
            - Always calculate total cash required, including taxes, not just the down payment.<br>
            - Advise clients to maintain a currency buffer (5–10%) if funds are in foreign currency.<br>
            - Prepare clients for immediate bridging if appraisal is lower than purchase price.
        </div>

        <div class="checklist">
            ✅ Verify client liquid funds.<br>
            ✅ Calculate taxes and fees.<br>
            ✅ Prepare LTV vs cash illustration.<br>
            ✅ Recommend currency buffer for non-EUR funds.
        </div>

        <div class="script">
            "We can finance up to 70% of the property's value. To cover the remaining amount plus taxes, you will need approximately 40–45% of the purchase price in cash."
        </div>

        <button class="tip-btn" onclick="toggleTip('tipQ1')">Tips & Examples</button>
        <div id="tipQ1" class="tip-content">
            <strong>Example 1 – US client:</strong> Buying €400,000 apartment. Max bank loan 70% = €280,000. Down payment €120,000 + taxes €48,000 → total cash €168,000 (~42%).<br><br>
            <strong>Example 2 – UK client:</strong> Buying €250,000 villa. Max loan 65% = €162,500. Down payment €87,500 + taxes €30,000 → total €117,500 (~47%).<br><br>
            <strong>Example 3 – Sweden client:</strong> Buying €500,000 townhouse. Max loan 70% = €350,000. Down payment €150,000 + taxes €60,000 → total €210,000 (~42%).
        </div>

        <h3>Q2. Debt-to-Income (DTI) – Avoiding the Silent Deal Killer</h3>
        <p><strong>Principle:</strong> DTI must remain below 30–35% of net monthly income. Exceeding 35% triggers bank rejection.</p>
        <p>The Debt-to-Income (DTI) ratio is a critical factor for Spanish banks when assessing mortgage applications. It must typically remain below <strong>30–35%</strong> of the client’s net monthly income to be considered safe and manageable.</p>
        
        <p>Exceeding <strong>40%</strong> of net income often triggers <strong>automatic rejection</strong> by the bank, as it signals excessive financial risk. This includes all monthly debt obligations, such as existing loans, credit card payments, and any other recurring financial commitments.</p>
        
        <p>Junior advisors should calculate DTI early in the process and guide clients to adjust their borrowing expectations or financial profile accordingly. Explaining the importance of DTI to clients helps prevent surprises and ensures smoother approval of their mortgage application.</p>
        <div class="advice">
            - Collect all global debts including mortgages, loans, and credit cards.<br>
            - Ensure transparency of all debts, including minimum payments.<br>
            - Use consistent calculation methods across nationalities.
        </div>

        <div class="checklist">
            ✅ Gather all debt info globally.<br>
            ✅ Calculate accurate DTI.<br>
            ✅ Advise client on debt reduction.<br>
            ✅ Confirm bank DTI thresholds.
        </div>

        <div class="script">
            "We include all your global debts to ensure your DTI is within bank limits. Any hidden or undisclosed debts can block approval."
        </div>

        <button class="tip-btn" onclick="toggleTip('tipQ2')">Tips & Examples</button>
        <div id="tipQ2" class="tip-content">
            <strong>Example 1 – UK client:</strong> €5,000 net/month, debts €1,500 → DTI 30% (acceptable).<br>
            <strong>Example 2 – Polish client:</strong> €6,000 net/month, debts €2,500 → DTI 41% (needs debt reduction).<br>
            <strong>Example 3 – UAE client:</strong> €12,000 net/month, debts €2,400 → DTI 20% (excellent).
        </div>

        <h3>Q3. Property Appraisal (Tasación) – The Final Word</h3>
        <p><strong>Principle:</strong> Bank loan is based on the lower of purchase price or appraisal. Client must provide extra cash if appraisal is lower.</p>
        <p>In Spanish mortgage lending, the bank loan is always based on the <strong>lower value</strong> between the agreed purchase price and the official property appraisal (tasación). This ensures that the bank does not over-lend relative to the property’s market value.</p>
        
          <p>If the appraisal comes in lower than the purchase price, the client must provide the <strong>difference in cash</strong> in addition to their planned down payment. This extra requirement covers the gap between the bank’s financed amount and the seller’s price, ensuring the transaction can proceed.</p>
        
          <p>Junior advisors should review appraisal results carefully and communicate promptly with clients about any shortfall. Proper guidance helps clients prepare the necessary funds in advance and prevents last-minute surprises at closing.</p>
            <div class="advice">
            - Explain the impact of appraisal.<br>
            - Show tables with loan gap.<br>
            - Advise liquidity for shortfall.
        </div>

        <div class="checklist">
            ✅ Confirm appraisal value.<br>
            ✅ Calculate max loan.<br>
            ✅ Show required extra cash.<br>
            ✅ Include taxes/fees.
        </div>

        <div class="script">
            "The bank bases your loan on the appraisal. If it is lower than your agreed price, you must cover the difference immediately."
        </div>

        <button class="tip-btn" onclick="toggleTip('tipQ3')">Tips & Examples</button>
        <div id="tipQ3" class="tip-content">
            <strong>Example 1 – Sweden client:</strong> Buying €500,000, appraisal €480,000, 65% LTV → max loan €312,000. Client covers €168,000 + taxes €45,000 = €213,000 (~42.6%).<br>
            <strong>Example 2 – US client:</strong> Buying €400,000, appraisal €350,000, 70% LTV → max loan €245,000. Client covers €155,000 + taxes €42,000 = €197,000 (~49%).<br>
            <strong>Example 3 – UK client:</strong> Buying €250,000, appraisal €240,000, 65% LTV → max loan €156,000. Client covers €84,000 + taxes €28,000 = €112,000 (~44.8%).
        </div>
        <h3>Q4. Self-Employed Clients – Proving Stability</h3>
        <p><strong>Principle:</strong> Spanish banks require self-employed clients to demonstrate financial stability over a period of <strong>3 years of fiscal activity</strong>. This usually involves providing tax returns, official income statements, and sometimes additional financial documentation to prove consistent earnings.</p>
        
        <p>The bank will typically calculate an <strong>average stable income</strong> from the submitted years to determine affordability and risk. Fluctuations are reviewed carefully, as banks prefer clients with predictable, steady earnings.</p>
        
        <p>Junior advisors should ensure self-employed clients gather all required documentation in advance, and explain how income will be assessed. This helps avoid delays or surprises during the mortgage approval process.</p>
    
        <div class="advice">
            - Collect tax forms for 3 years (US: 1040 + Schedule C, UK: SA302, Poland: PIT).<br>
            - Average income, avoid peak year.<br>
            - Provide explanations for fluctuations.
        </div>

        <div class="checklist">
            ✅ Collect tax documents.<br>
            ✅ Calculate average net income.<br>
            ✅ Ensure proof of stability.<br>
            ✅ Prepare notes for bank if variable.
        </div>

        <div class="script">
            "We calculate your average income over 3 years to demonstrate stability for mortgage approval."
        </div>

        <button class="tip-btn" onclick="toggleTip('tipQ4')">Tips & Examples</button>
        <div id="tipQ4" class="tip-content">
            <strong>Example 1 – US client:</strong> 2022 $80k, 2023 $60k, 2024 $25 → average $55k.<br>
            <strong>Example 2 – Polish client:</strong> 2022 PLN100k, 2023 PLN90k, 2024 PLN95k → average PLN95k.<br>
            <strong>Example 3 – UK client:</strong> 2022 £50k, 2023 £55k, 2024 £75k → average £60k.
        </div>
        <h3>Q5. Source of Funds – AML Compliance</h3>
        <p><strong>Principle:</strong> Spanish banks require that all funds used for property purchase are <strong>fully traceable</strong> to comply with Anti-Money Laundering (AML) regulations. This ensures transparency and legal compliance throughout the mortgage process.</p>
        
        <p>Funds originating from <strong>cryptocurrencies or cash</strong> must be properly documented. Banks may require <strong>proof of conversion or transaction history</strong> and a period of <strong>“bank seasoning” of 3–6 months</strong> to demonstrate that the funds have been held in a legitimate bank account prior to the property transaction.</p>
        
        <p>Junior advisors should guide clients in providing the necessary documentation early, explaining what constitutes acceptable proof of funds, and ensure funds are transferred well in advance of signing. Proper preparation prevents delays or complications during mortgage approval.</p>
        <div class="advice">
            - Advise early bank deposit.<br>
            - Collect proof of crypto liquidation + tax declaration.<br>
            - Avoid untraceable cash.
        </div>

        <div class="checklist">
            ✅ Verify origin of funds.<br>
            ✅ Collect crypto documentation.<br>
            ✅ Check AML compliance.<br>
            ✅ Advise seasoning period.
        </div>

        <div class="script">

        <h3>Q6. Credit History – Ensuring Bank Confidence</h3>
        <p><strong>Principle:</strong> Spanish banks place strong emphasis on a client’s <strong>credit history</strong>. A clean record, with timely payments on existing loans, credit cards, and other financial obligations, is essential to demonstrate financial responsibility.</p>
        
        <p>Negative marks such as late payments, defaults, or high debt levels can impact the bank’s decision or reduce the maximum loan amount offered. Banks typically review both local and international credit records for non-resident clients.</p>
        
        <p>Junior advisors should check clients’ credit reports early, advise on potential issues, and recommend corrective actions if necessary. Clear communication helps clients understand how credit history affects mortgage approval and terms.</p>
    
        <div class="advice">
            - Request credit reports from all relevant countries early in the process.<br>
            - Identify and address any late payments or negative entries before submission.<br>
            - Document all findings and advise the client clearly on potential impacts.
        </div>

        <div class="checklist">
            ✅ Request the client’s credit reports from all relevant countries.<br>
            ✅ Verify payment history on loans, credit cards, and other obligations.<br>
            ✅ Identify any negative entries or potential issues.<br>
            ✅ Advise client on actions to correct or mitigate issues before mortgage submission.<br>
            ✅ Document all findings and communications in the CRM.

        <h2 style="text-align:center;">II. DOCUMENTATION ESSENTIALS (Bank-Ready Files)</h2>
        <h3>Q7. ID, NIE & Tax Residency Proof</h3>
        <p><strong>Principle:</strong> Each buyer must provide valid ID, NIE (Spanish tax number), and proof of current tax residency.</p>
        <p>The bank verifies the authenticity and consistency of the documents. Any inconsistencies between the ID, NIE, and tax residency proof can cause delays in the approval process or even require resubmission of documents. For joint purchases, each buyer must provide their own documentation, and the bank reviews all files separately.</p>

        <p>It is important to check the validity of passports (at least 6 months remaining at the time of signing) and ensure the NIE is correctly listed on all documents, including the purchase contract. Tax residency proof can be in the form of an official certificate, tax return, or equivalent document from the client’s home country. Foreign documents may require certified translation to meet bank standards.</p>

        <p>Junior advisors should guide clients to gather these documents early, verify that all details are consistent, and ensure translations or certifications are complete. Proper preparation prevents delays, reduces stress for clients, and ensures the mortgage process proceeds smoothly.</p>
        <div class="advice">
            - Passport must be valid at least 6 months after signing.<br>
            - Passport or NIE must appear correctly on all documents, including purchase contract.<br>
            - Proof of tax residency (tax return or certificate) is mandatory for all non-residents.
        </div>

        <div class="checklist">
            ✅ Collect passport and NIE copies.<br>
            ✅ Verify consistency across documents.<br>
            ✅ Request tax residency certificate or latest tax return.<br>
            ✅ Send to bank for compliance check.
        </div>

        <div class="script">
            "To process your mortgage, the bank needs your valid passport, NIE, and proof of tax residency in your home country."
        </div>

        <button class="tip-btn" onclick="toggleTip('tipQ7')">Tips & Examples</button>
        <div id="tipQ7" class="tip-content">
            <strong>Example 1 – US client:</strong> Passport valid, IRS tax return + NIE copy accepted.<br>
            <strong>Example 2 – UK client:</strong> HMRC certificate used instead of tax return → accepted.<br>
            <strong>Example 3 – Swiss client:</strong> No NIE → delayed until getting it.
        </div>
        <h3>Q8. Income Proof – Salaried Clients</h3>
        <p><strong>Principle:</strong> Banks require 6 months of payslips and 2 years of tax returns to verify that the client has a stable and sufficient income to support the mortgage. This documentation demonstrates affordability and reduces the bank’s risk.</p>

        <p>The bank will carefully review payslips to ensure consistency in salary, bonuses, and deductions. Tax returns are used to confirm that declared income aligns with official records. Any discrepancies between payslips and tax returns may trigger additional questions or require clarification.</p>

        <p>Junior advisors should ensure that clients collect all necessary payslips and tax returns before submitting the mortgage application. It is important to check that all documents are complete, legible, and cover the required time period. Missing or incomplete documents can delay bank approval.</p>

        <p>For clients with variable income, such as those receiving commissions or bonuses, the bank may calculate an average monthly income to assess affordability. Advisors should prepare clients to provide supporting documents, such as bonus statements or employment confirmation letters.</p>
        <div class="advice">
            - Verify employer and consistency between gross/net amounts.<br>
            - Avoid gaps between contracts.<br>
            - Translate if not in English or Spanish (sworn if necessary).
        </div>

        <div class="checklist">
            ✅ Collect payslips (6 months).<br>
            ✅ Obtain last tax return or equivalent.<br>
            ✅ Cross-check income stability.<br>
            ✅ Provide certified translations if required.
        </div>

        <div class="script">
            "The bank needs your last payslips and tax returns to confirm stable income and ensure you meet mortgage affordability criteria."
        </div>

        <button class="tip-btn" onclick="toggleTip('tipQ8')">Tips & Examples</button>
        <div id="tipQ8" class="tip-content">
            <strong>Example 1 – UK client:</strong> 6 payslips + P60 accepted.<br>
            <strong>Example 2 – Norway client:</strong> Skatteetaten summary + salary slips accepted.<br>
            <strong>Example 3 – UAE client:</strong> Employer letter + 6 payslips → manual verification required.
        </div>
        <h3>Q9. Bank Statements – Showing Savings & Stability</h3>
        <p><strong>Principle:</strong> Banks analyze 6 months of bank statements from all relevant accounts to confirm that the client has sufficient liquidity and that the funds are consistent with declared income. This helps the bank verify the client’s financial stability and ensures they can cover the down payment, taxes, and fees associated with the purchase.</p>

        <p>Bank statements are carefully reviewed to detect unusual transfers, large deposits from unverified sources, or discrepancies with the declared income. Consistent savings patterns and regular account activity demonstrate financial discipline and reliability to the lender.</p>

        <p>Junior advisors should instruct clients to provide complete statements for all accounts that may impact the mortgage evaluation. Missing statements, incomplete periods, or unexplained transactions can delay approval or trigger additional bank inquiries.</p>

        <p>For clients using funds from multiple accounts, such as savings, investments, or joint accounts, it is important to document the source and history of these funds clearly. Proper preparation helps prevent last-minute issues and facilitates smooth mortgage processing.</p>

        <div class="advice">
            - Highlight consistent salary inflows.<br>
            - Remove or explain irregular large transfers.<br>
            - Ensure origin of down payment funds is visible.
        </div>

        <div class="checklist">
            ✅ Provide 6 months of statements of all accounts.<br>
            ✅ Mark salary inflows clearly.<br>
            ✅ Explain large deposits.<br>
            ✅ Match funds with declared savings.
        </div>

        <div class="script">
            "The bank reviews your recent statements to confirm consistent income and ensure all funds are traceable."
        </div>

        <button class="tip-btn" onclick="toggleTip('tipQ9')">Tips & Examples</button>
        <div id="tipQ9" class="tip-content">
            <strong>Example 1 – Sweden client:</strong> Salary consistent, savings visible → accepted.<br>
            <strong>Example 2 – Canada client:</strong> Large unexplained transfer → requested proof.<br>
            <strong>Example 3 – UK client:</strong> Joint account used, required partner declaration.
        </div>
        <h3>Q10. Tax Returns & Declarations – Country-Specific Rules</h3>
        <p><strong>Principle:</strong> Each bank requests tax returns (or the local equivalent) to confirm that the declared income matches official records. This ensures that the client’s financial profile is accurate and supports the mortgage application.</p>

        <p>Banks carefully review tax returns to verify reported income, deductions, and any other financial information relevant to the mortgage. Discrepancies between tax returns and other submitted documents, such as payslips or bank statements, may trigger additional questions or require clarification.</p>

        <p>Junior advisors should guide clients to provide complete and accurate tax returns, covering the required number of fiscal years as requested by the bank. For clients from countries with different tax systems, advisors should clarify what documents are accepted and whether certified translations are needed.</p>

        <p>Ensuring all tax documents are consistent with other financial documentation reduces delays and increases the likelihood of smooth mortgage approval. Proper organization and verification in advance helps prevent last-minute issues at the bank.</p>

        <div class="advice">
            - Identify local equivalents (e.g. P60 UK, IRS 1040 US, Skatteoppgjør Norway, PIT Poland).<br>
            - Provide complete pages, including income summaries.<br>
            - Verify all forms and figures are complete, legible, and consistent.
        </div>

        <div class="checklist">
            ✅ Confirm correct local tax document.<br>
            ✅ Ensure all pages included.<br>
            ✅ Match declared income with payslips.<br>
            ✅ Translate if not in English/Spanish.
        </div>

        <div class="script">
            "Please send your latest official tax return (or national equivalent). The bank uses it to confirm your declared income matches official records."

        <h2 style="text-align:center;">III. BANK ASSESSMENT & APPROVAL LOGIC</h2>
        <h3>Q11. Credit Scoring – How Banks Evaluate Risk</h3>
        <p><strong>Principle:</strong> Banks use internal credit scoring models to evaluate the risk of lending. These models consider multiple factors, including the client’s income, existing debts, type of property, nationality, residency status, and financial history.</p>

        <p>The score determines the bank’s decision on approval, maximum loan amount, interest rate, and conditions. Non-resident clients or those with complex financial profiles may be subject to stricter scoring criteria. Clients with lower scores might receive reduced loan amounts or higher interest rates, while higher scores can facilitate smoother approval.</p>

        <p>Junior advisors should explain to clients how these factors influence the mortgage outcome. Advisors can help clients prepare by ensuring that all documentation is complete, debts are accurately reported, and financial profiles are clear. Proper preparation improves the likelihood of a favorable score and reduces delays.</p>

    <div class="advice">
            - Different banks weigh criteria differently (LTV, DTI, employment type).<br>
            - Foreign income may be discounted (10–20%) depending on currency risk.<br>
            - Non-resident applicants are usually assessed more conservatively.
        </div>

        <div class="checklist">
            ✅ Identify bank's scoring criteria.<br>
            ✅ Provide complete financial documentation.<br>
            ✅ Note currency or residency adjustments.<br>
            ✅ Highlight stable income and low DTI.
        </div>

        <div class="script">
            "The bank evaluates each application based on income, debts, and property value. Foreign income may be adjusted slightly to account for currency risk."
        </div>

        <button class="tip-btn" onclick="toggleTip('tipQ11')">Tips & Examples</button>
        <div id="tipQ11" class="tip-content">
            <strong>Example 1 – US client:</strong> Stable income, 30% DTI → scoring 85/100 → approved.<br>
            <strong>Example 2 – UK client:</strong> Freelance income, 40% DTI → scoring 65/100 → conditional approval.<br>
            <strong>Example 3 – Sweden client:</strong> Resident, high savings → scoring 90/100 → smooth approval.
        </div>
        <h3>Q12. LTV Limits by Bank & Nationality</h3>
        <p><strong>Principle:</strong> Loan-to-Value (LTV) limits vary depending on the bank and the applicant type. Non-resident clients typically receive financing for 60–70% of the lower of purchase price or appraisal, while Spanish tax residents may access up to 80-90% financing. LTV also depends on property type, location, and the client’s financial profile.</p>

        <p>The bank uses LTV to assess risk: a lower LTV reduces exposure and increases the likelihood of approval. Clients should be prepared to contribute the remaining funds as a down payment, plus additional amounts for taxes, fees, and other costs.</p>

        <p>Junior advisors should explain LTV clearly to clients early in the process. This includes how LTV affects the required client contribution, mortgage insurance requirements, and potential impact on monthly payments. Proper understanding helps clients plan their budget and avoids surprises during closing.</p>

        <div class="advice">
            - Check bank-specific LTV tables.<br>
            - Consider lower LTV if property is rustic.<br>
            - Prepare clients for cash contribution if LTV lower than expected.
        </div>

        <div class="checklist">
            ✅ Verify LTV limits for client type.<br>
            ✅ Calculate required cash vs. bank financing.<br>
            ✅ Document any special conditions.<br>
            ✅ Communicate realistic expectations to client.
        </div>

        <div class="script">
            "Depending on your nationality and residency, the bank can finance 60–70% of the property. You will need to provide the remaining amount."
        </div>

        <button class="tip-btn" onclick="toggleTip('tipQ12')">Tips & Examples</button>
        <div id="tipQ12" class="tip-content">
            <strong>Example 1 – UK client:</strong> Non-resident, 65% LTV → €162,500 financed on €250,000 villa.<br>
            <strong>Example 2 – US client:</strong> Non-resident, 70% LTV → €280,000 on €400,000 apartment.<br>
            <strong>Example 3 – Spain resident:</strong> 80% LTV → €200,000 on €250,000 property.
        </div>
        <h3>Q13. Debt-to-Income & Affordability Checks</h3>
        <p><strong>Principle:</strong> Banks confirm mortgage affordability by analyzing the client’s monthly obligations in relation to their net income. For non-resident clients, the Debt-to-Income (DTI) ratio typically must remain below 35%, though exact limits vary by bank. Exceeding these limits can lead to reduced loan amounts or rejection of the mortgage application.</p>

        <p>The DTI calculation includes all existing debts, such as personal loans, credit cards, and other mortgages. Banks also consider projected mortgage payments and taxes. Advisors should ensure clients understand that higher DTI may require larger contributions from personal funds or adjustments to the loan terms.</p>

        <p>Junior advisors should review clients’ financial obligations in advance, ensure all income is accurately documented, and explain how the bank calculates DTI. This proactive approach helps prevent surprises and increases the likelihood of smooth mortgage approval.</p>

        <div class="advice">
            - Include all global debts, loans, credit cards.<br>
            - Verify consistency with submitted payslips and tax returns.<br>
            - Consider currency fluctuations if income is not in EUR.
        </div>

        <div class="checklist">
            ✅ Gather all debts.<br>
            ✅ Calculate accurate DTI.<br>
            ✅ Highlight non-EUR income.<br>
            ✅ Advise client if DTI exceeds bank limit.
        </div>

        <div class="script">
            "The bank reviews all debts and income to ensure the mortgage fits comfortably within your budget."
        </div>

        <button class="tip-btn" onclick="toggleTip('tipQ13')">Tips & Examples</button>
        <div id="tipQ13" class="tip-content">
            <strong>Example 1 – Sweden client:</strong> Net €6,000, debts €1,500 → DTI 25% → approved.<br>
            <strong>Example 2 – US client:</strong> Net $10,000, debts $4,500 → DTI 45% → reduction advised.<br>
            <strong>Example 3 – UK client:</strong> Joint income, low debts → DTI 28% → smooth approval.
        </div>
        <h3>Q14. Employment Type Adjustments – Salaried vs Self-Employed</h3>
        <p><strong>Principle:</strong> Self-employed applicants face stricter income assessment and averaging, typically over the last 3 fiscal years, and may have lower LTV limits compared to salaried employees. Banks assess the stability and predictability of income carefully to determine mortgage affordability.</p>

        <p>For salaried clients, banks usually require recent payslips and 2 years of tax returns. For self-employed clients, tax returns, business accounts, and proof of ongoing fiscal activity are analyzed to calculate an average stable income. Any fluctuations or inconsistencies may affect the maximum loan offered or trigger additional documentation requests.</p>

        <p>Junior advisors should guide self-employed clients to prepare complete and accurate income documentation well in advance. They should also explain how income averaging works and the potential impact on LTV and affordability. Early preparation helps avoid delays and ensures a smoother mortgage approval process.</p>

<div class="advice">
            - Provide tax returns + proof of activity.<br>
            - Prepare bank notes explaining fluctuations.<br>
            - Consider lower LTV or larger down payment for high-risk profiles.
        </div>

        <div class="checklist">
            ✅ Collect 3 years of income proof.<br>
            ✅ Document activity stability.<br>
            ✅ Identify potential LTV adjustments.<br>
            ✅ Notify client of implications.
        </div>

        <div class="script">
            "For self-employed clients, the bank reviews 3 years of income to ensure stability. Lower LTV may be applied if risk is higher."
        </div>

        <button class="tip-btn" onclick="toggleTip('tipQ14')">Tips & Examples</button>
        <div id="tipQ14" class="tip-content">
            <strong>Example 1 – UK client:</strong> 3 years freelance → LTV 65% → approved.<br>
            <strong>Example 2 – US client:</strong> 3 years fluctuating income → conditional approval, 60% LTV.<br>
            <strong>Example 3 – Sweden client:</strong> Stable consultant → full non-resident LTV → smooth approval.
        </div>
        <h3>Q15. Final Conditional Approval – Bank Notes & Exceptions</h3>
        <p><strong>Principle:</strong> Banks may issue final mortgage approval subject to specific conditions. These conditions can include providing additional funds, obtaining property insurance, submitting clarifications or corrected documentation, or addressing any issues raised during underwriting.</p>

        <p>Conditional approvals are common, especially for non-resident clients or those with complex financial situations. Advisors should carefully review all conditions outlined by the bank and explain them clearly to clients, ensuring they understand what needs to be done before the mortgage can be finalized.</p>

        <p>Junior advisors should monitor compliance with all conditions, collect and submit required documents promptly, and communicate updates to both the client and the bank. Proper handling of conditional approvals ensures smooth progression to the signing and closing stages, preventing last-minute delays or complications.</p>

        <div class="advice">
            - Review conditions carefully.<br>
            - Communicate clearly to client.<br>
            - Prepare supporting documents promptly to avoid delays.
        </div>

        <div class="checklist">
            ✅ Collect conditional approval letter.<br>
            ✅ Highlight all requirements.<br>
            ✅ Submit missing documents immediately.<br>
            ✅ Confirm timelines for fulfillment.
        </div>

        <div class="script">
            "The bank has issued conditional approval. We need to fulfill all listed requirements before signing can occur."

       <h2 style="text-align:center;">IV. LEGAL & NOTARY COORDINATION – Broker Responsibilities</h2>

<h3>Q16. Selecting a Notary & Lawyer – Coordination</h3>
<p><strong>Principle:</strong> Broker coordinates with a notary (Notario) and lawyer (Abogado) to ensure clients have experienced professionals for signing and legal compliance.</p>

<p>Choosing the right notary and lawyer is crucial for non-resident buyers. The broker recommends experienced professionals, explains their roles to the client, and ensures appointments are scheduled in coordination with the bank and client availability.</p>

<div class="advice">
    - Recommend notary and lawyer experienced with non-resident buyers.<br>
    - Verify client understands roles of notary and lawyer.<br>
    - Schedule notary appointment in coordination with client and bank.

        <h3>Q36. Properties with Co-Ownership Outside Mortgage Applicants</h3>
        <p><strong>Principle:</strong> If a property has other co-owners not on the mortgage, banks may require consent or agreements clarifying rights and obligations.</p>

        <div class="advice">
            - Collect co-owner consents.<br>
            - Define rights in purchase contract.<br>
            - Verify bank acceptance of partial ownership.
        </div>

        <div class="checklist">
            ✅ Obtain co-owner consents.<br>
            ✅ Define ownership & rights in contract.<br>
            ✅ Confirm bank approval.<br>
            ✅ Document all agreements.

        <div class="script">
            "Banks need clarity on other co-owners to ensure your mortgage and property rights are legally secure."

<div class="case-study">
  <h3>Case 5 – British Buyer: Self-Build Project in Costa Blanca</h3>
  <p><strong>Scenario:</strong> Mr. David Harper, a British citizen living in Manchester, plans to purchase a plot of land (€150,000) in Costa Blanca and build a villa with a total estimated project cost of €500,000. He wants financing for both land acquisition and construction. His goal: understand if Spanish banks will finance self-build projects for non-residents, and how disbursements work.</p>

  <h4>1. Preparation Before First Call</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Review Habeno’s policy and bank criteria for <strong>“autopromoción” (self-build loans)</strong>.</li>
    <li>Gather reference cases or examples of past approvals for non-residents.</li>
    <li>Prepare checklist of required documents: building license, construction budget, architect’s project, and land deed.</li>
    <li>Understand disbursement stages and the need for progress-based valuations.</li>
  </ul>

  <button class="tip-btn" onclick="toggleTip('tipC5A')">Tips & Examples</button>
  <div id="tipC5A" class="tip-content">
    <strong>Tip:</strong> Some Spanish banks (e.g., UCI, Bankinter) consider self-build cases for non-residents only if the land is already owned and construction is fully licensed. Disbursements occur in stages (land, foundation, structure, completion), each certified by a technical appraisal.
  </div>

  <h4>2. Interactive Question</h4>
  <p><strong>What is the key condition before the bank releases the first construction payment?</strong></p>
  <button onclick="showAnswer('ansC5Q1')">Show Answer</button>
  <p id="ansC5Q1" class="hidden"><strong>Answer:</strong> The building license must be approved and a certified appraisal (tasación) confirming the total project value must be in place. Without this, no disbursement can begin.</p>

  <h4>4. Interactive Question</h4>
  <p><strong>What loan structure would you propose for Mr. Harper’s case?</strong></p>
  <button onclick="showAnswer('ansC5Q2')">Show Answer</button>
  <p id="ansC5Q2" class="hidden"><strong>Answer:</strong> Recommend separating financing into two phases: <br>
  (1) Land purchase with client funds or bridge financing. <br>
  (2) Construction loan activated after license approval and appraisal, disbursed in stages. Explain that few banks offer full self-build loans to non-residents.</p>

  <h4>5. Key Challenges and Solutions</h4>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Challenge 1:</strong> Land not yet owned – most banks require ownership before mortgage setup.</li>
    <li><strong>Challenge 2:</strong> Delays in licensing – approval can take 3–6 months.</li>
    <li><strong>Challenge 3:</strong> Cost overruns – client must show contingency funds (typically 10–15% of project).</li>
  </ul>

  <button class="tip-btn" onclick="toggleTip('tipC5B')">Tips & Examples</button>
  <div id="tipC5B" class="tip-content">
    <strong>Example 1:</strong> A UK client in Javea obtained a 60% construction loan after showing proof of land ownership and full building permits.<br>
    <strong>Example 2:</strong> Some clients prefer two loans — one for land, one for construction — to simplify timing and interest accrual.<br>
    <strong>Example 3:</strong> Always confirm whether the bank requires stage certifications from Alia or Tinsa before releasing funds.
  </div>

  <h4>6. Final Interactive Reflection</h4>
  <p><strong>What advice would you give Mr. Harper to improve his approval chances?</strong></p>
  <button onclick="showAnswer('ansC5Q3')">Show Answer</button>
  <p id="ansC5Q3" class="hidden"><strong>Answer:</strong> Purchase the land first using his savings, obtain full architectural plans and license, and request a pre-approval showing the project’s financial feasibility. This demonstrates commitment and reduces bank risk.</p>

<h3>8.DTI Calculation – Extended Scenarios for Non-Resident Clients</h3>

<p>This section provides detailed examples of DTI calculation for non-resident clients, covering multiple nationalities and common debt situations.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Debts considered by Spanish banks:</strong> mortgages, rent, personal loans, car loans, leasing, alimony/child support, credit card minimums, legally binding obligations.</li>
<li><strong>Net income calculation:</strong> monthly income after taxes and social contributions. Self-employed: average net income over 2–3 years.</li>
<li><strong>Currency adjustment:</strong> Convert foreign currency to EUR, apply 5–10% FX safety discount.</li>
<li><strong>DTI formula:</strong> <em>DTI (%) = Total Monthly Debts ÷ Net Monthly Income × 100</em></li>
</ul>

<p>Practical Examples</p>
<h4>Sweden – Employed</h4>
<div class="checklist">
Income: SEK 60,000/month → €5,400 → €4,860 (10% FX discount)<br>
Debts:<br>
- Mortgage SEK 15,000 → €1,350<br>
- Car loan SEK 3,000 → €270<br>
- Credit card minimum SEK 500 → €45<br>
Total debts = €1,665<br>
DTI = 1,665 ÷ 4,860 ≈ 34.3% → acceptable
</div>
<h4>UK – Employed with Alimony</h4>

- Car loan $400 → €360<br>
- Credit card min $200 → €180<br>

- Credit card CHF 200 → €174<br>
Total debts = €3,659<br>
DTI = 3,659 ÷ 11,700 ≈ 31.3% → acceptable
</div>
<p>Key Notes & Recommendations<p3>

<li>Always include all legally binding debts; missing items may lead to bank rejection.</li>
<li>Apply FX discount for foreign income (5–10%) depending on currency volatility.</li>
<li>Use average income over 2–3 years for self-employed clients.</li>
<li>Document all assumptions in Credit Act for transparency.</li>
<li>Alert clients if DTI is high, suggest debt reduction or larger down payment.</li>
